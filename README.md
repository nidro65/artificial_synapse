# Artificial Synapse

This project was done as part of the assessment of the course Neuromorphic Engineering.

The objective was to model a synapse with a so called memristor.
A memristor is variable resistor whose resistance can be changed by a high voltage programming pulse.

We were able to show Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP), see following [picture](https://github.com/nidro65/artificial_synapse/blob/master/data_analysis/images/stdp_data_not_overlapping.png), and Paired-Pulse Facilitation (PPF).

## Get started

 - Open LTSpice
 - Open biolek_diffusive.sub with LTSpice
 - Right click on line 
 
 	.SUBCKT diffusive_biolek TE BE XSV
 	
 - Create symbol (autogenerate)
 - Same for biolek_drift.sub file
 - Open stdp.asc
 - Maybe replace block biolek_drift.asy and biolek_diffusive.asy, the symbols can be found in components (F2) under [autogenerated]
